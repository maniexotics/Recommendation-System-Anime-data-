Here's an overview of recommendation systems, their types, uses, advantages, and disadvantages:

2. **Content-Based Filtering**:
   - Recommends items similar to those a user has liked based on attributes or content descriptors.
   
3. **Hybrid Recommendation Systems**:
   - Combine collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and sometimes other techniques like demographic information to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations.

4. **Knowledge-Based Systems**:
   - Recommend items based on explicit knowledge about user preferences, needs, and constraints.
